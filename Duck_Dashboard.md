## Overview<a id="overview"></a>

With Duck Dashboard, you can track duck migration and analyze the duck population parameters, such as color and age.

The dashboard represents data in numerous formats: bar and pie charts, maps, and plots. Each dashboard element has controls that allow you to visualize the data in the clearest way.

## Average duck age by country<a id="average-duck-age-by-country"></a>

This bar chart shows the average duck age in years by the selected countries. To calculate that, the dashboard adds up years of all ducks in a country population and divides the sum by the number of the ducks.
